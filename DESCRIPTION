Description: An efficient data integration method is provided for multiple spatial transcriptomics data with non-cluster-relevant effects such as the complex batch effects. It unifies spatial factor analysis simultaneously with spatial clustering and embedding alignment, requiring only partially  shared cell/domain clusters across datasets. More details can be referred to Wei Liu, et al. (2022) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkac219>.
